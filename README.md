# RShiny
The R code to develop web applications using RShiny

You can develop interactive web applications in R using Shiny package by creating a user interface and server and Shiny compiles your code into the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
needed to display your application on the web.

Shiny applications have two components, a user interface object and a server function, that are passed as arguments to the shinyApp function that creates a Shiny app object from
this UI/server pair.

A simple shiny app is a directory containing “app.R” script, containing ui function, which controls the layout and appearance of your app, and server function, which contains
the instructions that your computer needs to build your app. Note that the names for the script is fixed, you should NOT use other names.
